// Features for the future:

// Array jobs (instantly queue or cancel many copies of a job, which vary by an env variable, GOQ_ARRAY_ID)

// Groups (for map reduce), so that a job can wait for all-of-a-group of jobs to complete.

// Redundancy: run 2x copies of each job, the first to finish cancels the others.
