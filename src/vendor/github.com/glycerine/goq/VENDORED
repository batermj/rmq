VENDORED DEPENDENCIES README
============================

NB: This has nothing to do with the Go 1.5 vendor/ directory
feature, although we've renamed our directory to vendored_deps/
to avoid conflicting interpretation under Go 1.5.

To make sure the project isn't broken by updates to its two
dependencies, capnproto and nanomsg, we vendor their sources
into two directories, vendored_deps/nanomsg and 
vendored_deps/capnproto. The versions there are
described below, along with their github origins.

During installation, if you are feeling excessively cautious,
you may utilize the vendored versions here to get
known-good/known-to-work versions. This protects the project
against future breaking-changes. In this case you
would skip installing capnproto and 
nanomsg from github, and instead run
"make installation" to install from the vendored_deps/ directory.

That said, the github most-recent versions of these projects
are likely fine. This is just in case.

Initial vendoring occurred at Sun May 11 14:43:35 PDT 2014.
