Description: Package rmq provides messaging based on msgpack and websockets. It demonstrates calling from R into Golang (Go) libraries to extend R with functionality available in Go. We use the Go library https://github.com/ugorji/go/codec for msgpack encoding and decoding. This is a high performance implementation, and supports the updated msgpack 2 (current) spec only. For websockets, we use the terrific https://github.com/gorilla/websocket library.
